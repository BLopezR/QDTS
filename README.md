# QDTS
The QKD Digital Twin Service (QDTS) is an tool that allows deploying digital twins of QKD networks over classical infrastructures.

The QDTS has been developed for a master thesis. To avoid plagiarism, the code and installation instructions will be uploaded to this repository on the 24/09/2023, giving enough time to the reviewers of the thesis to go over it before the defense.
